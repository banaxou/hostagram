**Hostagram** is a powerful OSINT tool for Instagram, designed to extract and monitor a maximum of information from any public (or accessible) Instagram account

## üö¶ Before You Start

  Some features require authentication
- **Hostagram never steals your password**  
- Use your own session ID for full access (public info only on private/locked accounts).
