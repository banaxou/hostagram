**Hostagram** is a powerful OSINT tool for Instagram, designed to extract and monitor as much information as possible from any public (or accessible) Instagram account

## üö¶ Before You Start

- **Create a dedicated Instagram account for OSINT purposes**  
  Some features require authentication
- **Hostagram never steals your password**  
- Use your own session ID for full access (only public info is available on private/locked accounts)

## üïµÔ∏è Hostagram Tutorial

To begin, you need to log in with either a password or a session ID
**If you connect using your session ID, you will have more access to information**

Once you are in the main menu, you have three functions: `user-info` `id-info` and `watch-user`

### 1 üë§‚Äã User Info
 ![user_info1 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06aeee7f-518c-487a-b3f2-3bcbb3a56e0c)
**Enter Instagram username**  
This feature allows you to retrieve a lot of information about an Instagram profile, such as:
- Username
- Followees
- Followers
- ID
- BIO
- Public email or obfuscated email
- Obfuscated phone and more  
The data is saved in both 'json' and 'txt'

**Enter user ID**  
If you have lost access to your target's Instagram account, or if your target has changed their username or blocked you, you can always find the account using their ID
This function uses the session ID for more information on the ID
The data is saved in both 'json' and 'txt'

### 3 üîé‚Äã Watch User
![warch-user1 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0248c8cb-8223-4d52-baf7-d5f1729b5c8b)

You can check if the account is active 
You can choose to monitor the profile by either user ID or username
The data is saved in both 'json' and 'txt'
