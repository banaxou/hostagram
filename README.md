**Hostagram** is an OSINT tool based on Instagram, designed to extract useful information such as:

* Full Name 📛  
* Instagram ID 🆔  
* Username 🧑‍💻  
* Account Type 🗂️  
* Number of Followers 👥  
* Number of Following ➕  
* Biography 📝  
* Mentions in Bio @  
* Hashtags in Bio #  
* Private Account Status 🔒  
* Verified Account (Blue Badge) ✅  
* Number of Posts & Stories 📸

* and much more..

> ⚠️ **Note**: Hostagram is still in development. Current version is **1.0**, with the final release expected to be **3.3**, bringing many new features!

## 🚨 Before Getting Started
I recommend creating a dedicated Instagram account for OSINT, This will allow you to connect to Hostagram Note that without a connection some features of the tool will not be available,
Hostagram will never steal your passwords !!

## Main Features

### 1. `user-info`  
Retrieves and stores all information of the target profile into a text file for secure data keeping. 🗃️

### 2. `id-info`  
Finds a user from their Instagram ID even if:  
* They changed their username

Perfect for finding a lost account. 🔍

### 3. `watch-user`  
Monitors real-time activity of a target profile. Any update (new follow, post, etc.) is shown directly in the terminal:
